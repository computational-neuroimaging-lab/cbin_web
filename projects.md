## Real-time fMRI Neurofeedback Based Stratification of Default Network Regulation
This project capitalizes on recent innovations in real-time fMRI (RT-fMRI) based neurofeedback to provide a dimensional profile of DN regulation that can be linked to cognitive and psychiatric phenotyping profiles, as well as underlying brain architecture. *This project is funded by NIMH BRAINS RO1: 1R01MH101555-01.*  

## Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes
The Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) is an open-source software pipeline for automated preprocessing and analysis of resting-state fMRI data. C-PAC builds upon a robust set of existing software packages including AFNI, FSL, and FreeSurfer, and makes it easy for both novice users and experts to explore their data using a wide array of analytic tools.

## Preprocessed Connectomes Project
The goal of the Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP) is to systematically preprocess datasets available in neuroimaging datasharing repositories and to share the results. The hope is to engage a broad audience of data scientists and neuroscientists in neuroimaging research by reducing the barrier to entry. <a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io" target="_blank">[webpage]</a>


## Characterizing inter-individual variation in the functional connectome
The Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory has several previous and current research projects aimed at developing methods for mapping inter-individual variation in the functional connectome:
